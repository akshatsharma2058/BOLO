# BOLO
Be on LookOut
Safety isn't expensive, it's priceless. Gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world. Our platform BOLO(Be on lookout), currently under construction is a web based platform which aims to make India a safer and better place for women because new India's growth isn't possible without ensuring women's security.

Alongside we also present a flagship product called Bolo+, which is an NLP(Natural Language Processing) based addon that detects and cleanses abuse on social media in hinglish. The dataset for this was taken from previously scraped tweets.
